# Validate Playwright Tests Without Flaky Selectors

Modern websites are dynamic, so static selectors can be challenging to maintain. This causes tests to break with code changes. 
Some things like `img` and `canvas` content are impossible to validate with selectors alone. GoodLooks.ai lets you validate visual changes with natural language prompts. 

## Demo

- mobile responsive
- design, spacing
- images
